## Why This Guide Exists

Modern AI inference and training workloads are dominated by matrix operations. Understanding how these operations execute at the hardware level—specifically through Matrix Fused Multiply-Add (MFMA) instructions—is essential knowledge for anyone serious about GPU kernel optimisation.

This repository exists because:

1. **MFMA documentation is scattered** — AMD provides excellent ISA manuals, but connecting theory to practice requires working through examples.

2. **Most tutorials target NVIDIA** — The CUDA ecosystem has decades of educational material. AMD's ROCm ecosystem, whilst technically mature, lacks beginner-friendly progressive learning paths.

3. **Kernel programming is a rare skill** — Fewer than a hundred engineers globally possess deep expertise in AMD-specific matrix instruction programming. This guide aims to expand that number.

4. **Open-source inference engines need contributors** — Projects like vLLM, Composable Kernel, and ROCm libraries require developers who understand the underlying hardware.

We encourage you to type every line of code manually rather than copy-pasting. The muscle memory and the errors you encounter along the way are part of the learning process.

## AMD vs NVIDIA: Technical Context

This section provides factual technical comparisons to help you understand the AMD ecosystem. We present these as engineering considerations, not product recommendations.

### Architectural Differences

| Aspect | AMD CDNA3 (MI300X) | NVIDIA Hopper (H100) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Wavefront/Warp Size | 64 threads | 32 threads |
| Matrix Unit | MFMA (Matrix Core) | Tensor Core |
| Shared Memory Term | LDS (Local Data Share) | Shared Memory |
| Register File | VGPR + AGPR (Accumulation) | Unified Register File |
| Memory | 192 GB HBM3 | 80 GB HBM3 |
| Compute Dies | 8 XCDs per package | Monolithic |

### Why Learn AMD Kernel Programming?

**1. Open-Source Software Stack**

ROCm is fully open-source from the compiler (LLVM-based) through runtime libraries. You can read, modify, and understand every layer of the stack. This transparency is invaluable for learning and debugging.

```
# You can inspect generated assembly directly
hipcc --offload-arch=gfx942 -S -o kernel.s kernel.cpp
```

**2. Growing Deployment Footprint**

AMD Instinct GPUs power several of the world's largest supercomputers (Frontier, LUMI, El Capitan). Enterprise adoption is expanding, creating demand for developers with AMD-specific expertise.

**3. Transferable Concepts**

The fundamental concepts—wavefront execution, memory coalescing, occupancy optimisation, matrix tiling—transfer between vendors. Learning on AMD makes you a better GPU programmer overall.

**4. HIP Portability**

HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) code can compile for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Skills learned here apply broadly:

```cpp
// This kernel compiles for both gfx942 (AMD) and sm_90 (NVIDIA)
__global__ void vector_add(float* c, const float* a, const float* b, int n) {
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (tid < n) c[tid] = a[tid] + b[tid];
}
```

**5. Composable Kernel Expertise**

AMD's Composable Kernel (CK) library is the foundation for high-performance GEMM and attention kernels in the ROCm ecosystem. Understanding MFMA is prerequisite knowledge for contributing to CK.

### Honest Limitations

- **Ecosystem maturity**: CUDA has broader library support and more community resources.
- **Tooling**: NVIDIA's profiling tools (Nsight) are more polished than ROCm's rocprof.
- **Documentation**: AMD documentation, whilst comprehensive, can be harder to navigate.

These limitations are improving rapidly, but awareness helps set realistic expectations.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access a GPU Instance

Follow the [Getting Free GPU Access](#getting-free-gpu-access) section to obtain an MI300X instance.

Once connected via SSH, verify your environment:

```bash
# Check GPU is visible
rocminfo | grep -E "Name:.*gfx"

# Expected output includes:
#   Name:                    gfx942

# Verify compiler
hipcc --version

# Expected: HIP version with ROCm path
```

### Step 2: Clone This Repository

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bogdannadev/mfma-cdna-amd.git
cd mfma-cdna-amd
```

### Step 3: Build and Run Your First Experiment

```bash
cd 01-hello-hip

# Build the experiment
hipcc --offload-arch=gfx942 -O3 -o hello_hip hello_hip.cpp

# Run it
./hello_hip
```

You should see device information and a simple computation result.

### Step 4: Study the Code

Open `hello_hip.cpp` in your editor and read through the comments carefully. The comments explain:
- Why we use `__global__` for kernel functions
- How thread indexing works
- Why bounds checking is essential
- How memory transfers between host and device

**We strongly encourage typing the code yourself** rather than running the pre-written version. The act of typing, making mistakes, and debugging builds deeper understanding.

### Using the Makefile

For convenience, a Makefile is provided:

```bash
# From repository root
make help          # Show available targets
make exp01         # Build experiment 01
make exp02         # Build experiment 02
make all           # Build all experiments
make run           # Build and run all experiments
make clean         # Remove built binaries
```

### Examining Generated Assembly

Understanding what the compiler generates is crucial for optimisation:

```bash
# Generate assembly file
hipcc --offload-arch=gfx942 -O3 -S -o kernel.s hello_hip.cpp

# Or save all intermediate files
hipcc --offload-arch=gfx942 -O3 --save-temps -o hello_hip hello_hip.cpp
```

Look for MFMA instructions in experiments 04 and 05:
```asm
v_mfma_f32_32x32x8_f16 a[0:15], v[0:1], v[2:3], a[0:15]
```

### Profiling Your Kernels

Use rocprof to measure kernel performance:

```bash
# Basic timing statistics
rocprof --stats ./hello_hip

# Detailed hardware counters
echo "pmc: SQ_WAVES, SQ_INSTS_VALU, SQ_INSTS_LDS" > counters.txt
rocprof -i counters.txt ./hello_hip
```
